          <p class="mb-4 opacity-75">
            I started out my career (many) years ago as a marketeer, working for
            reknowned companies in the tourism, fitness and real estate areas. 
          </br>
          </br>
            A few years later, right after my first solo trip around the world, I
            travelled back in time to revive a dear passion of mine: writing. My
            CV now featured the additional job title of "Content Writer". 
            <br>
            <br>
            Then, all of a sudden, I discovered what Front-end Developing was all
            about. I was hooked. The constant challenge and excitment of seeing
            things working exactly like they were meant to work on the web was
            exactly what I had been looking for. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Nowadays, I thrive on developing websites using HTML, Javascript and CSS. And the frequent
            "aHA" moments that coding offers me, are what I live for.
